  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>What is cidafm?</h3>
  <p>cidafm (Context Import Document + AI Function Module) is a modular AI behavior protocol. It works by using a single prompt to activate a system of reusable behavior components called AFMs (AI Function Modules). These components — along with system context — can be imported through CIDs (Context Import Documents), or declared directly through prompts. Once activated, the system can respond to additional prompt-based inputs to add, remove, or adjust behavioral logic — all without writing a line of code.</p>

  <h3>How do you pronounce it?</h3>
  <p>cidafm is pronounced like “Sid Affum,” with the emphasis on “daf.”</p>
