cidafm is an open-source framework for modularized AI behavior modification, which can be activated with a single prompt. (no code needed) While the final version of cidafm.com is currently under development, here's a short explanation on how to set up and use cidafm: 
1. Go to cidafm.com
2. Copy the init prompt
3. Paste it into ChatGPT or some other chatbot (it's only been tested for GPT-4, use at your own risk)
4. Download my custom AFM library, then import it into the chat along with "!import-cid" somewhere in the prompt (not in quotes)
5. Try out the AFMs, or try to develop your own!
6. Ask the AI how it would improve cidafm, or how it would improve a specific AFM (optional)
