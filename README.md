The final version of cidafm.com is currently in development. How to use:
1. Go to cidafm.com
2. Copy the init prompt
3. Paste it into GPT-4 or some other chatbot (it's only been tested for GPT-4, use at your own risk!!)
4. Optional Pt I: Download my custom AFM library, then import it into the chat along with "!import-cid" somewhere in the prompt (not in quotes!)
5. Optional Pt II: Try out the AFM's, and try to develop your own!
6. Optional Pt III: Ask the AI how it would improve cidafm, or how it would improve a specific AFM
